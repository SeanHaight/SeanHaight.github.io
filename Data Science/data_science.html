        <h1> Arbutus Map</h1>
        I used iNaturalist data to create a range map for the species in the genus <a href="https://www.inaturalist.org/taxa/51047-Arbutus"> Arubuts</a>.
        Rather than mapping individual observations I wrote a clustering algorthim to group the observations into reasonable populations and constructed polygons for each population.
        You can find the map <a href="../GeoDjango/index.html"> here </a> and the github with all the code <a href=https://github.com/SeanHaight/madroneRange>here </a>.

        <h1> Salmon Viability</h1>
        Working together with three other students I modeled Salmon viability in the Strait of Georgia using a wide variety of environmental factors. 
        You can find a link to the github <a href="https://github.com/SeanHaight/SalmonPopulationProject">here</a>.

        <h1> Plant Phenology Labeling </h1>
        I developed a image classification model to distinguish between photos of roses in bloom and those that are not in bloom. 
        To do this I trained a convolutional neural network on 4000 labeled iNaturalist images. 
        For just roses I achieved a generalization accuracy of 93%. 
        I'm currently working to expand this model from just roses to all angiosperms in the Northwest, excluding Poaceae (grasses).
