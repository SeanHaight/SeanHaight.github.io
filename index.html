        I am a 6th year Ph. D. student at the University of Oregon studying under the direction of Dr. Ellen Eischen.
        My dissertation generalizes the theory of Hermitian Jacobi forms to degree greater than 2 and gives some non-vanishing results for the Fourier coefficients
        of Hermitian modular forms as a consequence. Outside of math I am interested in the natural world. I am very active on <a href = "https://www.inaturalist.org/people/3861712">iNaturalist</a> 
        both with the uploading of my own observations and with the identification of others. You can see some of the best photos I've taken under the Nature tab.
        I also paint landscapes which you can find under the Art tab. Alongside these are tabs for a number of computer-based projects I've worked on over the last few months.
